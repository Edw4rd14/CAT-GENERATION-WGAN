# 🐈 CAT-GENERATION-WGAN

<b>Description:</b>

This project was on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically on Wasserstein GANs with weight clipping and gradient clipping being applied onto a dataset of cat faces trained on generating synthetic images of cat faces. This includes a technical paper written about it as well. This project was done as a part of my Deep Learning assignment.
